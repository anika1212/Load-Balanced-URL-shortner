Developed a containerized URL shortener service that allowed users to submit long URLs and receive shortened versions. 
The system was designed to be scalable using Docker and Kubernetes, with a load balancer distributing incoming requests across multiple service instances. 
Data was stored in an in-memory key-value store running in a separate container to ensure fast access and efficient performance.
